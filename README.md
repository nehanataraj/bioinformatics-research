# bioinformatics-research
Comparative study of alternative pvalue weighting methods and a statistical model determining how q-values vary by their percentage tagged variance (PTV) for 16 traits.

# More Info
Datasets accessible via UK Biobank. Research aims to find a p-value weighting method that best determines the likelihood a trait is linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).
