Datasets accessible via UK Biobank. Research aims to find a p-value weighting method that best determines the likelihood a trait is linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Complex human traits like height, intelligence, and mental health disorders are highly heritable (70-80%) but are controlled by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants, each with very small individual effects. Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) face a "needle in a haystack" problem - searching through millions of genetic variants to find the few hundred that actually matter, requiring extremely stringent statistical thresholds that make discovery difficult. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging genomic databases to identify regions of the genome that are more likely to contain causative variants for specific traits. Rather than testing all genetic variants equally, the approach uses prior biological knowledge to prioritize certain genomic regions, effectively "searching smaller haystacks" where needles are more likely to be found. By focusing statistical power on these high-probability regions, the method aims to improve the detection of true genetic associations while reducing the multiple testing burden that makes complex trait mapping so challenging.
